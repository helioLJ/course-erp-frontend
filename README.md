# Portal Trilogia - Management System üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è

The inspiration for this personal project was my mom's business. She owns a Nurse Technical Course and needs to manage it using software that is not as efficient as Word, Excel, or even the old paper system.

So, using my Fullstack Developer skills, I am developing an end-to-end CRUD to solve administrative problems and handle student data, such as names, documents, payments, grades, and more.

This project is still under development, but you can see some gifs below:

Obs: This repository is solely for the front-end, which consumes my own API created using Node.js.
## Demonstration

Obs: this is the Admin View, content and permissions are different for Admins, Students and Teachers.
